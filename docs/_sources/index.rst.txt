COVID-19 Analysis Repository
===========================================

This is a repository with on-going analysis I'm working on for COVID-19
on different countries.

.. note:: I'm not an epidemiologist, I have some background on epidemiology due to my background
          on biomedical engineering, but I'm a Machine Learning engineer/researcher. However, data
          is data and statistics is statistics. Please read about the limitations on each modelling
          approach, as this is very important for you to understand what you're looking. In case
          of doubt, please contact me on my `personal blog <http://blog.christianperone.com>`_ or
          `twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tarantulae>`_. If you use something from this work,
          please consider citing it.
