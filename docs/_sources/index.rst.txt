COVID-19 Analysis Repository
===========================================

.. note:: My name is Christian S. Perone and I'm a Computer Scientist with BSc in Computer Science (UPF/Brazil) and a MSc in
          Biomedical Engineering (Polytechnique Montreal/UdeM/Canada). This website contains analysis related
          to the COVID-19 outbreak for Brazil and Portugal. Please read about the
          limitations on each modelling approach, as this is very important for you to
          understand what you're looking. In case
          of doubt, please contact me on my `personal blog <http://blog.christianperone.com>`_ or
          `twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tarantulae>`_. If you use something from this work,
