COVID-19 Analysis Repository
===========================================

This is a repository with on-going analysis I'm working on for COVID-19
on different countries.

.. warning:: I'm not an epidemiologist, I have some background on epidemiology due to my background
             on biomedical engineering, but I'm a Machine Learning engineer/researcher. Please read
             about the limitations on each modelling approach, as this is very important for you
             to understand what you're looking. In case of doubts, please contact me.
